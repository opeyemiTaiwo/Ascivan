// src/utils/foundationsCourses.js
// The Foundations course library. Courses are authored as markdown under
// src/Pages/courses/<Track>/*.md and pulled in at build time by
// scripts/generateCourses.js (which writes foundationsCoursesData.js).
//
// This replaces the old foundationsContent.js (short external checklists) and
// foundationsLessons.js (short on-platform lessons). Foundations is now a growing
// library of practical, project-based courses that take a newcomer from zero to a
// portfolio piece. To add a course, drop a new .md into the right track folder and
// rebuild - nothing here needs editing.

import { COURSES_BY_TRACK } from './foundationsCoursesData';

// Display name + one-line intro per track. Kept here (not derived from a course file)
// so a track can show a heading even before its first course lands. Company is a
// special, non-skill track: a short guide on reading badges and ratings.
