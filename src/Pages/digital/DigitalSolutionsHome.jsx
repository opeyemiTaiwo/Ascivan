const FAQs = [
  {
    question: "What does Loomiq do?",
    answer: "Loomiq builds cutting-edge technology solutions for businesses. We transform web and mobile applications into intelligent systems using AI, automation, and data-driven architecture. We also run an all-in-one platform for international students — explore it from our homepage."
  },
  {
    question: "How is Loomiq different from other development companies?",
    answer: "We don't just build websites — we design intelligent systems that automate, analyze, and evolve. Every engagement starts with strategy, and our solutions are built to scale with your business."
  },
  {
    question: "How does your consultation and project process work?",
    answer: "We start every engagement with a consultation fee. This covers your discovery session, initial scoping, and a custom proposal outlining our services, how we operate, project timelines, and transparent pricing. If you move forward and build with us, the fee is credited toward your project — it's part of your investment, not an extra charge. If you choose not to proceed, the consultation fee is non-refundable. For full details on our process, refund policy, pricing structure, and intellectual property terms, please review our Terms of Service at loomiq.com/solutions/terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Is the consultation fee refundable?",
    answer: "The consultation fee is strictly non-refundable. It compensates our team for the dedicated time and expertise invested in your discovery session and custom proposal preparation. However, if you choose to build with us, this fee is applied as a credit toward your total project cost. We encourage you to read our full Terms of Service at loomiq.com/solutions/terms before proceeding, so you have complete clarity on our policies."
  },
  {
    question: "Can you integrate AI into my existing platform?",
    answer: "Absolutely. One of our core services is AI Integration and Digital Transformation. We upgrade existing web and mobile platforms with AI capabilities including chatbots, recommendation engines, predictive analytics, workflow automation, and custom AI APIs — without rebuilding from scratch."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you build mobile applications?",
    answer: "Yes! We build AI-powered native and cross-platform mobile applications for both iOS and Android. Our mobile solutions include real-time personalization, intelligent notifications, analytics dashboards, and scalable backend integrations."
  },
  {
    question: "What industries do you serve?",
    answer: "We partner with forward-thinking organizations across multiple sectors including financial services, healthcare, education, e-commerce, professional services, growth-stage startups, enterprise teams, and research organizations."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you offer career guidance or tech training?",
    answer: "Yes! Our student platform helps international students find jobs, housing, financial aid, and build a professional network. Head to our homepage to get started for free."
  },
  {
    question: "Will I be working with real people or just AI?",
    answer: "Both! While we use AI-powered tools to streamline assessments, roadmaps, and initial consultations, every project and inquiry is reviewed and handled by our real human team. For business solutions, a dedicated team member will personally follow up within 24 hours. For career guidance, our ProjectX program pairs you with real teams on real projects, and you can request a dedicated career coach for one-on-one support. Our AI tools enhance the experience, but real people are always behind the work."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide AI strategy and consulting?",
    answer: "Yes. We offer AI readiness assessments, digital transformation roadmaps, product architecture planning, MVP strategy development, implementation planning, and ongoing optimization support. We help you build the right intelligent system before building the product."
  },
  {
    question: "Do you provide ongoing support?",
    answer: "Absolutely. Our commitment extends beyond launch. We provide reliable ongoing support, maintenance, optimization, and updates to ensure your intelligent systems continue to perform and evolve as your business grows. Support terms are outlined in your individual Project Agreement — for more details, see our Terms of Service at loomiq.com/solutions/terms."
  },
  {
    question: "Where can I review your full policies, pricing structure, and legal terms?",
    answer: "All of our engagement policies — including the consultation fee structure, refund terms, how we price projects, intellectual property ownership, and our full operating process — are documented in our Terms of Service. We strongly encourage every prospective client to read it before starting a consultation. You can access it at loomiq.com/solutions/terms or by clicking the Terms of Service link in the footer of this page."
