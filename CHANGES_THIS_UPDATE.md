# Changes in this update (latest)

## 1. Profiles - "Projects Done" replaces the Skill Track chip
- The stats row on member profiles now shows Badges / Certificates /
  "Projects Done". The Skill Track chip was removed from the stats row
  (the skill track still shows in the Details section below).
- Projects Done auto-populates from the projects collection: every project
  with status 'completed' where the user was a team member (matched by uid
  OR email in the members array) or the project owner - paid or free -
  counted once per project. Paid projects therefore count toward the total
  but still never add badges.

## 2. Company projects skip the Ascivan review
- Company / organisation accounts no longer submit their projects for
  review. On the Complete Project page, company owners go straight to the
  project summary -> evaluation -> completion (payment confirmations on
  paid projects). The review gate, "Submit for review" card, and the
  "Approved by Ascivan" banner only apply to individual owners.

## 3. Approval notifications open the right page (not the Proof Wall)
- Clicking a "has been approved" (or needs-changes / rejected) notification
  now opens the project itself: the completion / manage-project page for
  the owner, the project workspace for team members. Previously it fell
  through to /community, which redirects to the Proof Wall.
- Fixed in BOTH the Notifications page and the bell dropdown. Payment /
  dispute notifications in the dropdown now open the dispute room, and
  application/completion notifications open the project.

## 4. Paid projects actually close when everyone confirms (root-cause fix)
- checkAndCompleteProject previously only *checked* readiness - the comment
  referenced an autoCompletePaidProject Cloud Function that does not exist,
  so a fully-confirmed paid project stayed at 'awaiting_payment_confirmation'
  forever. It now performs the status flip to 'completed' itself, so the
  project immediately leaves "Awaiting Payment Confirmation" on the owner's
  Manage Projects page, the team's Project Vault, and the dispute list, and
  moves to the completed wall.
- SELF-HEAL for already-stuck projects: the Project Vault, the dispute room,
  the disputes list, and the owner dashboard now detect a paid project where
  the owner marked everyone paid AND every member confirmed, flip it to
  'completed' on load, and show it as completed right away. This also fixes
  projects that got stuck after a dispute was resolved via an amount
  adjustment + re-confirmation.

## 5. Paid projects - badge wording removed from the completion flow
- The green banner after review approval now reads "Approved by Ascivan -
  you can now rate contributions and start payment confirmations." on paid
  projects (badges wording kept for free projects only). Companies see no
  banner at all since they skip review.
- The final "done" screen on paid projects now says "Work Marked Done" with
  payment-confirmation wording (and "All payments confirmed" once closed)
  instead of "Badges and certificates have been awarded", and its second
  button is "Payment Confirmations" (opens the Project Vault) instead of
  "Browse Projects".
- Re-opening the Complete page on a paid project already in the payment
  phase now shows the done screen instead of letting the owner re-run the
  evaluation.

# Changes in the previous update

## 1. Vendor branding hidden from all error messages
- New `src/utils/sanitizeError.js` strips the word "Firebase", raw codes like
  `(auth/...)`, and rewords "Firestore" before anything is shown to users.
- `getAuthErrorMessage` (src/firebase/config.js) now has a dedicated, friendly
  message for the password-policy error:
  "Your password doesn't meet the requirements: Password must contain a
  non-alphanumeric character." - and its default fallback is sanitized.
- New `src/utils/toastSanitizer.js` (imported once in src/index.jsx) wraps
  react-toastify app-wide, so ANY toast on ANY page is scrubbed of vendor
  branding as a safety net - no per-page changes needed, nothing breaks.
- Admin setup pages and the Privacy Policy were reworded ("Google Cloud"
  instead of naming the vendor).
- Note: some auto-generated project templates list "Firebase" as a required
  SKILL for member-built projects (a technology members might use). Those were
  left as-is since they describe member project stacks, not the platform.

## 2. Projects page - Free / Paid filter
- "All Projects" listing now has a dropdown: All Projects / Paid Projects /
  Free (Collaborative) Projects, included in the Clear All logic.

## 3. Editors see all Foundations courses
- Accounts with role `editor` now see every track with courses, same as admins.

## 4. Proof Wall & Workspace - desktop layout
- Both pages are now capped at `max-w-3xl` and centered on large screens.
  Mobile/handheld layout is unchanged.

## 5. Images show in full at a glance
- Proof Wall updates and Workspace discussion attachments now use
  `object-contain` (letterboxed on a light background) so the whole image -
  top and bottom - is visible in the feed. Click-to-open full size (lightbox)
  is kept exactly as before.

## 6. Proof Wall - "All Activity" tab
- Individuals: new default "All Activity" tab showing every update type
  (project updates, needs-a-lead, badges, ships, milestones) PLUS a compact
  "Open projects" strip at the top (with a View all link to the Open tab).
- Companies: new default "All Activity" tab showing all updates PLUS a compact
  "Top talent" strip at the top (with a View all link to the Top Talent tab).

## 7. Proof Wall - Top Talent empty state
- Removed "or get top ratings for teaching"; it now reads
  "Members who earn badges will appear here."

## 8. Applications - third "Request Info" button
- Project owners now see Approve / Reject / Request Info on every pending
  application. Request Info opens a small composer (pre-filled with
  "Send me your portfolio.") and sends the message to the applicant
  (in-app notification + push).
- The applicant sees the owner's message on My Projects → Applied and can
  reply with a LINK ONLY (validated URL; a brief note tells them so). The
  owner is notified and sees the link right on the application card.

## 9. Profile picture upload + profile editing for all accounts
- Settings → Edit Profile now starts with a profile-picture section: current
  photo (or initial), with "Upload a photo" / "Change photo". Works for
  email/password accounts (which have no Google picture) and for Google/Gmail
  accounts that want to change theirs. The photo is saved to the user document
  and synced to the auth profile so it shows everywhere.
- Every member (including Gmail sign-ins) already gets the "Edit Profile"
  button on their own profile page, which opens this Settings tab.

## 10. AI recommendations (projects + Foundations courses)
- New `src/utils/aiRecommendations.js`: gathers the member's profile (academic
  background, primary track, experience level, skills, interests), badges
  earned (`member_badges`), and roles they've held/applied for; gathers up to
  20 open active projects (excluding their own and ones they already applied
  to) and the Foundations course catalog (excluding courses they've finished);
  sends ONE compact prompt to Claude (`claude-haiku-4-5-20251001`) through the
  existing `/api/claude-proxy` (the API key stays server-side) and asks for
  strict JSON: up to 4 projects (with a match % and a one-line personalized
  reason) and up to 4 courses (with a reason).
- Every id the model returns is validated against the real candidate lists -
  anything invented is dropped - and hydrated with real titles.
- Results are cached on the user document (`users/{uid}.aiRecs`) for 24 hours
  or until the profile / candidate pool changes, so a dashboard visit doesn't
  cost an API call. A Refresh button forces regeneration.
- New `src/components/AIRecommendations.jsx`: "Recommended for you" card on the
  member dashboard (individuals only) with two columns - Projects to join
  (title, Paid/industry chips, match %, reason, View & apply) and Foundations
  courses (title, track chip, reason, Start learning). Skeleton loading state;
  fails quietly (renders nothing) if the AI is unavailable, so the dashboard
  never breaks.

## 11. Interests: editable in Settings (bug fix + AI signal)
- Interests were only collected in onboarding step 4 ("What are you looking
  for?"), that step is optional, and the promised "editable later" editor never
  existed. Worse: Settings required interests for profileComplete but gave no
  way to set them - members who skipped the step could never complete their
  profile.
- Settings → Edit Profile now has an "What are you interested in?" picker
  (same options as onboarding, individual + company variants). Saved to
  users/{uid}.interests, and profileComplete now uses the edited form value.
- These interests also feed the AI recommendations prompt; when empty, the AI
  falls back to education, track, level, skills, badges, and roles held.

## 12. Industry interests (topical signal for recommendations)
- New shared list `src/utils/industryTracks.js` - the exact same 21 industries
  projects are tagged with, so member interests line up 1:1 with project tags.
- Onboarding step 4 now also asks "Which industries interest you?" (optional
  chip multi-select, individuals).
- Settings → Edit Profile has the same "Industries you're interested in"
  picker (individuals), saved to users/{uid}.industryInterests.
- The AI recommendation prompt now includes their industry interests (as
  human-readable labels) and is instructed to strongly prefer projects in
  those industries. Changing industries invalidates the 24h cache
  automatically, so fresh picks generate on the next dashboard visit.

## 13. Email verification: branded page with a Sign in button
- Problem: verification emails linked to Firebase's default hosted page
  (ascivan-5b4f4.firebaseapp.com) which says "you can now sign in" with NO
  link - and exposes the vendor domain.
- New `api/auth/send-verification.js` (mirrors the existing send-reset.js):
  generates the verification code with the Admin SDK and emails a branded
  Ascivan message whose button links to ascivan.com/auth/action - the app's
  existing branded page that confirms the email and shows a "Sign in now"
  button.
- AuthContext now sends signup + resend verification through this endpoint
  (with the default sender kept only as a fallback if the endpoint fails).
- Uses the SAME env vars already configured for send-reset: EMAIL_USER,
  EMAIL_PASSWORD, FIREBASE_PROJECT_ID, FIREBASE_PRIVATE_KEY,
  FIREBASE_CLIENT_EMAIL - nothing new to set up.
- RECOMMENDED (console, optional): Firebase Console → Authentication →
  Templates → pencil icon → "Customize action URL" →
  https://ascivan.com/auth/action - this also reroutes any OTHER default
  emails (e.g. email-change notices) to the branded page.

## 14. Recommendations v2: best matches (bug fix + refinements)
- BUG FIX: the candidate query only fetched status=='active' projects, but
  most of the pool sits in 'lead_recruitment' (needs a lead) - so the AI often
  had zero projects to pick from and only recommended courses. The query now
  matches the Projects page pool: ['active', 'lead_recruitment'].
- The card is now "Your best matches": exactly ONE best project + ONE best
  course, side by side. Needs-a-lead projects get an orange chip and an
  "apply to lead" CTA; smaller AI response budget (400 tokens).
- Added a brief profile nudge under the heading: "Keep your profile fresh for
  sharper matches" linking to Settings.
- Cache fingerprint versioned (v:2) so members' old 4-item cached
  recommendations regenerate automatically on next visit.
- Foundations page: one-line intro added under the heading: "Practical,
  beginner-friendly courses that take you from zero to your first real
  project."

## 15. Foundations: AI course spotlight (no shuffling)
- Decision: the track library stays in its normal, predictable order (courses
  are sequential learning paths - reshuffling them by AI between visits would
  be disorienting and add API cost/latency).
- Instead, a "Recommended for you" spotlight now appears at the top of the
  Foundations library (individuals only) showing the member's AI-picked best
  course with its personalized reason and an "Open course" button that jumps
  straight into it (switching track if needed).
- Zero extra cost: it reads the cached pick straight off the user document the
  page already loads. Hidden if there's no cached pick, if the course was
  completed, or while reading a course.

## 16. Proof Wall polish (mobile tabs, tip moved to FAQ)
- The filter chips (All Activity / Updates / Needs a lead / Open projects) now
  sit on a single horizontally-scrollable line instead of wrapping into an
  uneven stack on phones - the standard mobile chip pattern (scrollbar hidden).
- The blue "Tip" banner was removed from the Proof Wall header.
- The tip now lives in the Support page FAQ as "How do I get the most out of
  the Proof Wall?", reworded to say "hiring companies" instead of
  "recruiters", with added guidance (attach an image, post consistently).

## 17. Sidebar + owner dashboard tweaks
- Sidebar Projects group now has three sub-items: All Projects, My Projects
  (the manage-your-posted-projects page, /projects/owner-dashboard), and
  Project Vault.
- Removed the "Pending Apps" stat card from the My Projects page (jargon that
  could read as worrying); the stats grid is now three cards - Total Projects,
  Team Members, Completed. Pending applications are still fully visible per
  project via the "Applications (N)" button on each project card.

## 18. Foundations: every track open to every individual
- Previously an individual only saw tabs for tracks they held a badge in plus
  their primary track - so a TechDev exploring TechGuard couldn't reach the
  TechGuard courses (despite the FAQ promising free Foundations in every
  track, and beginner Guard roles being open to them on projects).
- Now every individual sees every track that has courses. Their own tracks
  (badge tracks, then primary track) are listed first, the rest follow. The
  company badges guide stays company-only; company and admin/editor behavior
  unchanged. Progress is still tracked per track as before.

## 19. Profile picture viewer
- On any member's profile page, the profile picture is now clickable: tapping
  it opens a full-size lightbox (dark overlay, close button, tap-anywhere to
  dismiss). Avatars elsewhere in the app (Proof Wall, Discussion, directory)
  keep their existing behavior of navigating to the person's profile - from
  which the picture can then be viewed full size.

## 20. Sidebar: fixed double-highlight + spacing
- Clicking "My Projects" no longer also highlights "All Projects" (the active
  check matched any /projects/* path; it now excludes the sibling sub-pages,
  while still highlighting All Projects on the listing and project detail
  pages).
- Slightly increased spacing between the Projects sub-menu items for clearer
  separation.

## 21. "Find your first project": one best match
- The dashboard cold-start section now shows only the single best-matched
  project instead of three (the "Browse all projects" link covers the rest).
  Intro copy adjusted to match ("Here's a project that fits your profile").

## 22. Proof Wall All Activity strips: two items
- The "Open projects" strip (individuals) and "Top talent" strip (companies)
  on the All Activity tab now show two items instead of three - the View all
  link covers the rest.

## 23. Applicant messaging: Request Info now opens a real conversation
- Problem: the "request portfolio" notification routed applicants to the wrong
  page, and the link-only reply flow was clunky.
- Now the owner's Request Info message creates (or reuses) a Messages
  conversation between owner and applicant, drops the request in as a chat
  message with project context ('About your application for "X" (Role): ...'),
  and increments the applicant's unread count.
- The applicant's notification now routes straight to that conversation
  (/messages?with=owner); the push notification links to /messages too.
- My Projects (applied tab) shows the owner's message with an "Open
  conversation" button instead of the old link-only reply form (removed).
- The owner's application card shows "You asked ..." with an "Open
  conversation" link.
- Deliberate: owner->applicant conversations are created directly, bypassing
  the Premium "contact talent" gate - the applicant applied to the owner's
  project, so this contact is legitimate; and per existing rules, replies in
  an existing conversation are always unlimited for both sides.

## 24. Request Info: message only, no notification entry
- The owner's Request Info message no longer creates an entry on the
  Notifications page. It goes straight to the applicant's Messages inbox as a
  chat message, lighting up the Messages unread badge in the sidebar like any
  other message. The push (device) notification is kept - same as normal
  messages - and links to the inbox. The Notifications-page routing for the
  old notification type is kept so previously-sent notifications still open
  the right conversation.
