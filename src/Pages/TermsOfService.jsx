    { title: '1. Acceptance of Terms', content: 'By accessing or using Loomiqe ("the Platform"), you agree to be bound by these Terms of Service. If you do not agree, please do not use the Platform. Loomiqe is a project-based platform for tech professionals to collaborate, earn badges, and build their careers.' },
    { title: '2. Eligibility', content: 'You must be at least 18 years old to use Loomiqe. By creating an account, you represent that you are at least 18 and have the legal capacity to enter into these terms.' },
    { title: '3. User Accounts', content: 'You are responsible for maintaining the confidentiality of your account credentials and for all activities under your account. You agree to provide accurate information during registration and to keep it updated. Notify us immediately of any unauthorized use.' },
    { title: '4. Acceptable Use', content: 'You agree not to: post false, misleading, or fraudulent content; harass, abuse, or threaten other users; use the Platform for any illegal purpose; scrape or extract data from the Platform; impersonate another person; post spam or malware; or violate any applicable laws.' },
    { title: '5. User-Generated Content', content: 'You retain ownership of content you post. By posting, you grant Loomiqe a non-exclusive, worldwide, royalty-free license to use, display, and distribute your content on the Platform. You are responsible for ensuring your content does not infringe on third-party rights.' },
    { title: '6. Projects and Collaboration', content: 'Loomiqe provides a platform to create, join, and manage collaborative projects. Projects can be free or paid. Both types contribute to TechTalent Badge progress upon completion. Loomiqe does not manage, guarantee, or enforce any project deliverables, timelines, or outcomes. Project owners are solely responsible for managing their teams.' },
    { title: '7. Project Payments and Transactions', content: 'Loomiqe does not collect, process, or hold any payment information.

Each party is responsible for keeping receipts and records.' },
    { title: '8. Payment Confirmation and Disputes', content: 'For paid projects, all team members must confirm they have been paid before the project can be marked as completed and badges awarded. If a member has not been paid, they may file a dispute through the project page. Disputes are flagged to the project owner and Loomiqe administrators. The project cannot be finalized until all disputes are resolved. Loomiqe facilitates dispute visibility but is not a party to financial transactions and is not liable for non-payment. Dispute and confirmation history is recorded and visible in the Project Vault.' },
    { title: '9. TechTalent Badges', content: 'TechTalent Badges are earned automatically when a project is completed. Badge type is determined by the member\'s role in the project (e.g., developer earns TechDev, QA earns TechQA). Badge level (Novice, Associate, Advanced, Expert) is determined by the number of projects completed in that track. Project owners automatically receive a TechLeads badge and a certificate upon project completion. Badges are non-transferable and represent participation in specific project categories.' },
    { title: '10. Membership Tiers', content: 'Loomiqe offers a Free tier (access to projects, community, messaging, and badges) and a Premium tier ($100/year, which includes Talent Board visibility and advanced features). All members are Free by default. Premium features may change over time.' },
    { title: '11. Email Visibility', content: 'Members can control whether their email address is visible to other members through the Email Visibility toggle in Settings. When set to private, your email is hidden from member profiles and the directory. Other members can still contact you through the platform\'s messaging system.' },
    { title: '12. Listing and User Disclaimer', content: 'All projects and content posted on Loomiqe are user-generated and not independently verified. Loomiqe does not verify the identity, credentials, or legitimacy of any user. Users should exercise judgment, conduct due diligence, and independently verify details before engaging. All user information is securely stored and can be used to investigate fraud or misconduct.' },
