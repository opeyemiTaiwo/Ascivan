## Project 1 (Module 1): Write a Solutions Brief for a Business Problem

**Goal:** Translate a business problem into a technical direction, the first move a solutions architect makes, before any diagram or code.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir solutions_brief_project
cd solutions_brief_project
```

**Step 2: Pick a realistic business problem.**
Example: "Our support team is overwhelmed by repetitive questions and response times are hurting customer satisfaction scores."

**Step 3: Identify stakeholders.**
```bash
nano brief.md
```
A **stakeholder** is anyone with a say in whether the solution succeeds, here, likely support leadership, IT/security, and end customers.

**Step 4: State business goals, not technical ones.**
Write 2–3 measurable business goals (e.g., "reduce average response time by 30%"), not technical goals ("deploy an LLM").

**Step 5: Note constraints.**
List budget range, timeline, existing systems that must be integrated with, and any compliance requirements (e.g., data residency, industry regulations).

**Step 6: Propose a technical direction (not a full design yet).**
Write 2–3 sentences: broadly, is this a good fit for AI, and roughly what kind of solution (e.g., "a retrieval-augmented chatbot integrated with the existing ticketing system")?

**Step 7: Assemble the final brief.**
Combine Steps 3–6 into one page: Business Problem → Stakeholders → Goals → Constraints → Proposed Direction.

## Project 2 (Module 2): Design a System Diagram for an AI Service

**Goal:** Visualize the service you're proposing, the first technical artifact that turns your Project 1 brief into something engineers can react to.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir system_diagram_project
cd system_diagram_project
```

**Step 2: List the major components.**
Based on your Project 1 brief, list the pieces the system will need: user-facing app, API layer, AI model, data store, integration with existing systems.

**Step 3: Understand standard architecture diagram conventions.**
Boxes typically represent **components** (services, databases); arrows represent **data flow** or **requests**, usually labeled with direction and what's being sent.

**Step 4: Draw the request flow.**
Sketch: User → App → API → AI Model → Response back to User, in that order, left to right or top to bottom.

**Step 5: Add the data layer.**
Add a box for where data is stored (database, vector store) and draw arrows showing which components read from or write to it.

**Step 6: Add integration points.**
Draw connections to any existing systems named in your Project 1 constraints (e.g., "existing ticketing system").

**Step 7: Label everything.**
Add labels to every arrow (what data/request is flowing) and every box (what the component does in one phrase).

**Step 8: Get a "can you read this cold" check.**
Show the diagram to someone unfamiliar with the project and ask them to explain back what they think it shows.

## Project 3 (Module 3): Compare Model Options for a Given Use Case

**Goal:** Decide which AI approach actually fits the problem, replacing assumption with a documented comparison.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir model_comparison_project
cd model_comparison_project
```

**Step 2: Define your evaluation criteria.**
```bash
nano criteria.md
```
Typical criteria include **accuracy/quality** for the task, **latency** (response speed), **cost per request**, **data privacy** (does data leave your infrastructure), and **ease of integration**.

**Step 3: Identify 2–4 candidate approaches.**
Examples: a general-purpose LLM API, a smaller open-weight model self-hosted, a fine-tuned specialized model, or a non-AI rules-based approach as a baseline.

**Step 4: Research each option against your criteria.**
```bash
nano comparison_matrix.md
```
Build a table: rows are your candidates, columns are your Step 2 criteria.

**Step 5: Understand the fine-tuning vs. prompting tradeoff.**
**prompting** (including RAG) adapts a general model's behavior at request time without changing its weights; **fine-tuning** further trains a model's weights on your specific data.

**Step 6: Estimate rough costs.**
For each candidate, estimate cost per 1,000 requests (API pricing) or infrastructure cost (self-hosted compute).

**Step 7: Make and justify a recommendation.**
```bash
nano recommendation.md
```
State which option you'd recommend and why, referencing your matrix directly.

## Project 4 (Module 4): Design an End-to-End AI System Architecture

**Goal:** Expand your Project 2 diagram into a full system design, the central architecture document for the whole solution.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir full_architecture_project
cd full_architecture_project
```
Copy in `system_diagram_v1.png` and `recommendation.md` from Projects 2 and 3.

**Step 2: Understand common reference architectures.**
A **RAG architecture** retrieves relevant data before generating a response; an **agentic architecture** lets the AI call tools/APIs to take actions; a **simple API-call architecture** just sends a prompt and returns a response.

**Step 3: Choose your architecture pattern.**
Based on Project 3's recommendation, decide which pattern (or combination) fits.

**Step 4: Expand the diagram with your chosen model.**
Update your Project 2 diagram to show your Project 3-selected model/approach specifically, not a generic "AI Model" box.

**Step 5: Add integration patterns.**
An **API gateway** manages external access to your service; a **message queue** handles asynchronous processing (useful if requests can take a while).

**Step 6: Address scalability.**
Note: what happens if traffic doubles? Where would this design bottleneck first?

**Step 7: Estimate rough costs for the full system.**
Combine your Project 3 model costs with rough infrastructure costs (hosting, storage, networking).

**Step 8: Write the architecture document.**
```bash
nano architecture.md
```
Structure: Pattern chosen and why → Full diagram → Components and their roles → Scalability notes → Rough cost estimate.

### Final Project Structure
```text
full_architecture_project/
│
├── architecture_diagram_v2.png
├── architecture.md
```

### What You Learned
✅ Common AI reference architecture patterns (RAG, agentic, simple API)
✅ Choosing a pattern based on a documented model comparison
✅ Adding integration patterns (API gateways, message queues)
✅ Identifying likely scalability bottlenecks
✅ Estimating full-system cost, not just model cost
✅ Writing a complete architecture document

### Portfolio Project
**End-to-End AI System Architecture**: Designed a complete AI system architecture using a chosen reference pattern (RAG/agentic/API), including integration design, scalability analysis, and full-system cost estimates.
**Skills:** System Architecture, Reference Architecture Patterns, Scalability Planning, Cost Estimation, AI Solutions Architecture.

**Deliverable:** A full architecture document and diagram, covering pattern choice, components, scalability, and cost.

## Project 5 (Module 5): Design the Data and Infrastructure Layer for an AI System

**Goal:** Fill in how data will move and be secured, the layer underneath the architecture you designed in Project 4.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir data_infra_layer_project
cd data_infra_layer_project
```

**Step 2: Design the data flow.**
Sketch: where does data enter the system, where is it stored, and where does it get deleted or archived?

**Step 3: Choose storage types.**
Match storage to data type: structured records → relational database; documents for retrieval → vector database; large files → object storage.

**Step 4: Design network security.**
**network segmentation** isolates different parts of a system so a breach in one area doesn't automatically expose everything; **encryption in transit** protects data moving between components, **encryption at rest** protects stored data.

**Step 5: Design access control.**
**least privilege** means each component or user only has the access it strictly needs, nothing more.

**Step 6: Address compliance requirements from Project 1.**
Revisit your Project 1 brief's constraints (e.g., data residency, industry regulations) and confirm your data layer design satisfies them.

**Step 7: Diagram the data and infrastructure layer.**
Draw storage components, network boundaries, and access control points as their own focused diagram.

**Step 8: Write the data and infrastructure design doc.**
```bash
nano data_infra_design.md
```
Structure: Data flow → Storage choices → Network security → Access control → Compliance mapping.

### Final Project Structure
```text
data_infra_layer_project/
│
├── data_flow_diagram.png
├── data_infra_design.md
```

### What You Learned
✅ Designing end-to-end data flow, including deletion/archival
✅ Matching storage types to data types
✅ Network segmentation and encryption fundamentals
✅ Designing access control with least privilege
✅ Mapping design decisions to compliance requirements
✅ Producing a focused data and infrastructure design document

### Portfolio Project

## Project 6 (Module 6): Write a Governance and Risk Plan

**Goal:** Address compliance and responsible-use concerns directly, the part of architecture that protects the organization, not just the system.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir governance_risk_project
cd governance_risk_project
```

**Step 2: Identify risk categories.**
Common categories include **data privacy risk** (mishandled personal data), **model risk** (biased or incorrect outputs), **operational risk** (system downtime affecting the business), and **reputational risk** (public-facing AI mistakes).

**Step 3: Assess each risk for your specific system.**
```bash
nano risk_assessment.md
```
For each category, note: how likely is this risk here, and how severe would it be if it happened?

**Step 4: Design mitigations for the highest risks.**
For your top 2–3 risks, write a specific mitigation (e.g., "add a human review step for high-stakes outputs," "log and audit all model responses for 90 days").

**Step 5: Define an incident response plan.**
An **incident response plan** describes what happens when something goes wrong, who's notified, how fast, and what the rollback process is.

**Step 6: Address responsible AI principles.**
Note how your design considers fairness (does the system perform differently across user groups), transparency (do users know they're interacting with AI), and accountability (who's responsible if it goes wrong).

**Step 7: Write the governance and risk plan.**
```bash
nano governance_risk_plan.md
```
Structure: Risk categories and assessment → Mitigations for top risks → Incident response plan → Responsible AI considerations.

### Final Project Structure
```text
governance_risk_project/
│
├── risk_assessment.md
├── governance_risk_plan.md
```

### What You Learned
✅ Identifying risk categories relevant to AI systems
✅ Assessing likelihood and severity for a specific system
✅ Designing mitigations for high-priority risks
✅ Writing an incident response plan
✅ Addressing fairness, transparency, and accountability
✅ Producing a complete governance and risk plan

## Project 7 (Module 7): Present a Full Architecture Proposal

**Goal:** Package everything into a presentation for stakeholders, the skill that actually gets an architecture approved and built.

**Step 1: Set up a project folder.**
```bash
mkdir architecture_proposal_project
cd architecture_proposal_project
```
Copy in your final deliverables from Projects 1–6.

**Step 2: Identify your audience.**
Presenting to a mixed audience (some technical, some business) means leading with business impact, then offering technical depth for those who want it.

**Step 3: Structure the presentation.**
```bash
nano presentation_outline.md
```
Draft outline: Problem & Goals (Project 1) → Proposed Solution Overview → Architecture (Project 4) → Data & Security (Project 5) → Risks & Governance (Project 6) → Cost & Timeline → Ask/Next Steps.

**Step 4: Build slides or a written proposal document.**
For each outline section, create one slide (or one section if written) with your key diagram or point from the matching earlier project.

**Step 5: Prepare for objections.**
```bash
nano anticipated_questions.md
```
List 5 likely tough questions (e.g., "why not just use approach X," "what if the model gets it wrong") and write your answers.

**Step 6: Define a clear ask.**
State exactly what you need from this audience (budget approval, engineering resources, a pilot green light).

**Step 7: Practice presenting it out loud.**
Run through the full presentation once, timed, ideally to another person.

**Step 8: Deliver (or record) the presentation.**
Present live or record yourself presenting the full proposal, including handling at least one of your anticipated tough questions.
